# TensorFlow-classifying-images-with-Fashion-MNIST
 Build and train a neural network to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts.
 
 
 This project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28  ×  28 pixels), as seen here:

 Fashion MNIST is intended as a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST dataset—often used as the "Hello, World" of machine learning programs for computer vision. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0, 1, 2, etc) in an identical format to the articles of clothing we'll use here.
